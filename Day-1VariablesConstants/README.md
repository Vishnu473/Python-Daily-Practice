We are working on Variables and Constants in Python.

**Variables in Python**
Variables are used to store information in Python that can change during the execution of a program. Python is dynamically typed, so you don’t need to declare the type of the variable; it’s inferred automatically.
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.8
is_student = True


**Constants in Python**
Python doesn’t have built-in constant types like some other languages (e.g., const in C or Java). However, the convention is to use uppercase variable names to indicate that a variable should be treated as a constant and should not change.
PI = 3.14159


**Exercises:**

1. Personal Information:
* Create variables to store your:
    * Name
    * Age
    * Country of residence
* Print out a sentence that introduces yourself using these variables (e.g., "Hi, my name is Alice, I'm 25 years old, and I live in the USA.").
2.Area of a Circle:
* Create a constant PI = 3.14159.
* Write a script that calculates the area of a circle. Use a variable for the radius, and print the area of the circle.
3.Temperature Conversion:
* Declare a variable to store a temperature in Celsius (e.g., temp_celsius = 25).
* Write a program to convert this temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula: temp_fahrenheit temp_fahrenheit=(temp_celsius×9/5)+32
* Print the result.
